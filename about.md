## Who the hell are you!?

Dylan Rose! I'm a PhD student in Peter Bex's Translational Vision Laboratory at Northeastern University.

The picture above is me, edge-filtered, when I had a much edgier haircut long ago. It was a simpler time.

## What on Earth could someone with such a dumb haircut possibly spend his days doing!?

Well, first, it's less dumb and edgy now than it used to be. Second, at the moment, I'm doing research in two main areas:

1. Developing methods to enhance oculomotor control in/improve information gathering from complex environments for individuals with:
   * Central visual field loss.
   * Various "-opsias" (disease states that produce blindness in portions of the visual field).
2. The use of eye movement data, in conjunction with image processing and machine learning methods, to perform biometric tasks, such as:
   * Ophthalmological and neuropsychological disease detection.
   * Behavior/user identification.

You can read more about what I'm doing with this stuff in my CV.

## Why on Earth does this page exist!?

I've never liked the idea of having to keep or maintain a blog, so this is a static portfolio that'll get updated when I feel like it. It therefore exists to serve as:

 1. a point of contact for those looking to get in touch with me for various reasons.
 2. a place to host copies of my academic work.
 3. a place to document various course-related or extracurricular projects that do things with data, or that otherwise make dumb art and services using deep learning.

Most of the content I have planned falls into the third category. My work, scientific and otherwise, has been done mostly between just me and my advisor. I've therefore never had much use for something like Github. I'd still like to be able to document what I've done over the years, however, so lots of code for each posted project is going to be right there in the initial commit. 

Nevertheless, in most cases it's been long enough and I've grown enough that I plan to edit and modify them to my current standard as show-pieces for various skills.
