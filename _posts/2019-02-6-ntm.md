There's plenty of explanatory text for this one in the [git repo](https://github.com/Hamcastle/Name-That-Meatball-) and in the app itself, so I'll keep it brief. **Name!That!Meatball** is an image captioning network I trained on pairs of photos of pets and their names I scraped from PetFinder. The point is to leverage the assumption that there's some association between a cat or a dog's visual properties and the kind of name they end up getting. It's a little buggy -- I think the model was somewhat over trained and so will occasionally fail to return a name for some images -- but I'm happy with it's performance. This pupper definitely seems like a Franny to me:

and unless somebody was screwing with me, it's occasionally freaky good...:
