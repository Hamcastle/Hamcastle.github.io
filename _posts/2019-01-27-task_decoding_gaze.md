If I had to summarize the focus of my scientific research, I'd say it all depends on the idea that human _eye movement_ turns out to be a good window into human _cognition_. Better, it's one that doesn't require a fancy magnet and millions of research dollars, just increasingly cheap, consumer grade tech eye trackers and something we all do all the time: looking at pictures and watching movies.

This is possible because the eye movement control system in the brain is plugged into a huge range of other brain networks:

*Like _really_ connected. See Itti, L. "New Eye-Tracking Techniques May Revolutionize Mental Health Screening. _Neuron_, 88(3),2015." * 

This project was something I did for one of my first data related classes in grad school: _Statistics for Big Data_. Our final assignment was a data analysis project using the statistical techniques we learned over the semester, which were classic statistical modeling techniques like ridge-regressions and linear discriminant analysis.
