If I had to summarize the arc of my scientific research, I'd say it all hinges on the idea that human _eye movement_ turns out to be a good window into human _cognition_. Better, it's one that doesn't require a fancy magnet and millions of research dollars, just increasingly cheap, consumer grade tech eye trackers and something we all do all the time: looking at pictures and watching movies.

This is possible because the eye movement control system in the brain is plugged into a huge range of other brain networks:

As a result of all those connections, if something makes a _transient_ change to the state of someone's brain (e.g. trying to complete a specific task) or a more fundamental change to their structure and function (e.g. a developmental or clinical condition), it's likely to end up encoded into patterns of eye movements.

This project was something I did for one of my first data related classes in grad school: _Statistics for Big Data_. Our final assignment was a data analysis project using the statistical techniques we learned over the semester, which were classic statistical modeling techniques like ridge-regressions and linear discriminant analysis.
